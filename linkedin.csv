About Us: Platform9: A Better Way to Go Cloud Native

Cloud native is a strategic priority for technology leaders at nearly every company around the world. Going to cloud native is a complex, challenging, but necessary process for businesses and organizations, regardless of size or industry.

As cloud native grows and matures, many enterprises are looking to leverage powerhouse technologies like Kubernetes to accelerate their adoption, but they are faced with a limited set of options. Public cloud Kubernetes is expensive and locks you into their infrastructure and platform services. DIY Kubernetes gives you more infrastructure flexibility and control, but it is challenging and requires operation skills you don’t have. Platform9 is the third option for your cloud-native future.

Platform9 is the only container management and orchestration solution that supports the complete lifecycle of the cloud-native journey on infrastructure anywhere. We combine the flexibility of DIY Kubernetes, with the simplicity of public cloud Kubernetes. Platform9 is a better way to go cloud native, paving the way for an open distributed cloud future.

Innovative enterprises like Juniper, Kingfisher Plc, Mavenir, Redfin, Rackspace and Cloudera achieve 4x faster time-to-market, up to 90% reduction in operational costs, and 99.99% uptime. Platform9 is an inclusive, globally distributed company backed by leading investors.
All this means that the future for Platform9, for our customers, and for our team is about as bright and exciting as it gets. It’s the best time to join our highly collaborative, friendly, and rich learning environment. We have a high energy start-up culture.

As the first luxury beauty and wellness buyers’ club, our products are sold directly to our members without the prohibitive industry mark-ups. Technology powers everything that we do, and contributes to making our business model unique!

As part of our team? You’ll learn a lot. (We’re all learning a lot.) You’ll be multi-tasking, you’ll make some great decisions and some bad ones. You’ll have highs and lows. It won’t be easy (because that would be boring). But you’ll be moving fast, identifying and solving problems, iterating and evolving, and you’ll bring your best to the game. In fact, it’s not very often you get an opportunity like this - to help grow a great brand, for a rocketship of a business that will scale in size and go global. One that thrills its customers. And delivers happiness. We'll be asking for your input, experience, teamwork, ideas, and camaraderie, while we navigate the unknown, the mysterious and the upside together!

A bit about our Technology: We are using the latest progressive and native web technologies, alongside headless e-commerce tools and systems, to create a shopping experience nothing like what people experience today. Technologies include Next.js and React, GraphQL, deployed with Terraform on AWS. Driven by data science, machine learning and analytics, from multi-variant testing through to personalising the shopping experience, every customer will have a unique and tailored experience just for them, across every digital channel.

The role: You're a Senior Engineer who wants to build high-quality user-centric applications with experience of shipping code at high cadence. You’re self-motivated and have a passion for solving complex business problems with simple technical solutions. As an experienced engineer, you’ll have exposure to a range of technologies, including some that feature in our stack: AWS, Node.js, Typescript.

Delivery of high quality, well tested, maintainable code
Offer counsel and support to other engineers during PR review
Work with the product owner to shape future work, plan releases, and measure success in the features you help to deliver

And finally

The code we write is largely based on Javascript, although we’re not afraid to explore new and emerging technologies and tools if they are right for us. Our progressive storefront uses Next.js for a lightning fast user experience that is discoverable by search engines. We use Chakra UI for our React component library to build a world class customer experience. We’ll likely build native at some point too, though we haven’t yet decided whether to build native or use React Native. No need to rush into decisions!

Our clients are separated from our core services by a GraphQL BFF, providing a clean abstraction and allowing the frontend to iterate independently from backend services. We use a combination of third party solutions and our own services built using node.js. We host all most of our technical estate within AWS, using Terraform to create consistent and reproducible environments.

It’s not all about the languages and tools we use. Continuously delivering business value through rapid delivery, learning and adapting is our mantra. We use the latest modern software delivery processes with an ambition to automate everything, branch, build, deploy, test, ship, watch, monitor and alert all fully automated, so we can focus on building an awesome experience for our customers and back office business.

Hey there, we're Crew. We're the exclusive talent partners for some of Australia's most impactful and innovative technology businesses. Like Yume❤️

There are no winners when food goes to waste. Time, money and resources have been wasted producing it, farmers and suppliers lose their income and the gases produced by the landfill created by food waste are 25x more deadly than the petrol emission from your car.

Yume started in Melbourne, as an exploration into FMCG food manufacturers to find out what was behind the astronomical amount of food waste in Australia. 42% of our annual food waste comes directly from the commercial sector. That’s 3.2 million tonnes of food going to waste before it even makes it to supermarket shelves, let alone the homes of the people it was made for.

Job Description

This role is really all about continuing and building on the work that's already been done. It's about bringing ownership of the code base and infrastructure back in-house from a 3rd party supplier and continuing to build and deploy features that make it easy for Yume customers to interact on the platform.

As the initial sole Engineer, you'll work with the cross-functional product team to help to deliver the roadmap, drive operational excellence and be the voice of technology within the business.

With a Series A raise planned for 12 months time and milestones to be met in order to get there, the team is laser-focused on this and the growth beyond.

You can expect a 3-month transition & handover with the current outsourced team, which should provide plenty of opportunity to understand the architecture & code base, the technical decision-making to date and to plan for the future.

You'll also be pivotal in leading the growth of the future Engineering team which is expected to happen within 3-6 months.

The core skills and competencies required to be successful in this role are:

A relevant degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering.
5+ years of commercial development experience.
Commercial experience working within a cross-functional product team. (i.e.You've interacted directly with Product Managers and UX Designers
High-level written and verbal communication skills. (You can comfortably distil technical information to a non-technical audience)
A bias for pragmatism and balancing the needs of the business with the needs of the user.
Experience working in development teams using the Agile Methodology.
A desire to continually innovate and improve all aspects of the development process. (You love trying new things whilst being as efficient as possible)
Experience working with Database systems.(Currently using Amazon Aurora)
Commercial expertise in developing systems using a PHP backend and Vue JS frontend.
Commercial experience working with infrastructure built on AWS. (Ideally, you'd have some kind of AWS certification)
A good understanding of UX concepts and designs.
Experience with DevOps and building a successful DevOps pathway.
Experience with Code management, branches, master branches and merges.
Qualifications

You'd most likely be going to the top of our shortlist if you also:

Have conceptual and maybe even practical knowledge of DevSecOps and can provide guidance around platform security.
Have had some experience in hiring junior team members through being directly involved with interviewing and hiring decision-making.
Are a Polyglot when it comes to technology. i.e. You prefer using the technology that makes the most sense, rather than being wed to one language or solution.

This role is perfect for someone who is looking for more responsibility and to fast track their career. It’s a role that’s hands on in the code and system development but also works with the product team, broader business and customers.

Ultimately, it’s a role that helpes fuel the ability of the business to continue making a massive impact on the problem of food wastage.

Additional Information

Think you might apply? Here’s some tips;

To be clear, this role is based in Melbourne. Unfortunately, we're not able to sponsor at this point, so overseas applicants should maybe focus on other roles.
Feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions you’d like to ask prior to formally applying. I’m here to help.
Cover letters. There’s no need to add one, but if you write one i’ll read it. But please dont just replicate details from your resume, if you’re going to the trouble of writing one make it insightful. E.g. How would you approach the role, how does the Yume mission connect with you, where have you done a similar role and how might that set you (and us) up for success?
We understand that no candidate will meet every single desired qualification. If your experience looks a little different but you genuinely feel that you have something to offer, we'd love to hear from you.
Our hiring process will involve an initial phone call to discuss the role and how your skills and experience might fit, we’ll ask you to share a github profile or some code you’re proud of, from there it’s 2 separate interviews with a take home technical challenge in the middle.",NA,Be among the first 25 applicants,Mid-Senior level,Full-time,1 week ago

About us

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild.

🌴Here at Aize, we work hard, and we play hard! That’s why most of us have packed our bags and jetted off to some well-deserved summer adventures. This means that our recruitment processes will run slower than usual or be temporarily paused. But fret not! some of us are still around so don't be surprised if you hear from us in July😉. We will be back in full swing for hiring starting in August. Until then...

Have a fabulous and cucumber-filled summer 🌞🥒

What You Tell Your Friends You Do

“I’m all about the user experience. Everything a user sees and interacts with, that’s what I’m responsible for. It needs to be slick, efficient and intuitive – which is all down to me.”

What You Will Really Be Doing

🚀 Creating remarkable software that our customers will love, using modern technologies

⭐️ Prioritize, coordinate and support the team’s daily work

❓ Getting challenged with complex and interesting problems

👩🏻‍💻 Mentoring and guiding junior developers on your team

⚒️ Work alongside Architects and DevOps Engineers on technical architecture, deployment, and infrastructure

🎉 Contribute to shaping the culture and methodology of a growing software house

How Will You Be Doing This
You’re part of an agile, multidisciplinary team building features for our product. You bring your own unique skill set to the table and collaborate both with your own team members and other colleagues across teams to accomplish your goals.
Work with the UX designers from the concept phase to the specification and finalizing phase to derive the solution.
Collaborate with team members responsible for the API part, discuss and finalize the needs to make the process efficient.
You prioritize work with the team and its product owner, weighing both the business and technical value of each task.
Groom the tasks by understanding the functional aspect and applying the best technical solutioning to it.
Train and help the junior team members with your experience in technology and process, so that they grow and become an even bigger asset to the team.

What we have worked on and where we are going

We have set a product vision for the future and defined a one-product strategy for Aize. We are now moving into the execution phase and are in need of more doers who want to challenge themselves as well as us as a product company. As an organization, we’re constantly evolving which means that a lot of opportunities will appear as we move forward. Maybe you want to be an expert in a particular area, manage a team or even seek a different career path? At Aize you’ll have the opportunity to explore and evolve together with us.

Team

As we have different teams who are in need of new team member(s)r - we are open to hear about your skills, experiences and motivation before suggesting the right team for you. However, all our teams are cross functional and multidisciplinary - and even though you will be working in one product team with its responsibility for a feature, everything at Aize is so connected that you will essentially be involved in the development of the entire product.

A few teasers on what you might end up doing in our teams:
Help in making the code manageable and maintainable
Creating novel solutions for expressing information on web interfaces
Working extensively on Canvas and SVG elements of Web
Working with some of the brightest minds who work with 3D technologies
Innovating our 2D area and work on further developing functionality of smart documents
Work closely with designers and be involved in shaping the UX for a new feature

Who We Think You Are
Passionate about technology and driven by problem solving - we care about what we do, and so should you
Responsible and courageous - innovation is not something that just happens. You ask questions, participate in discussions, disagree with your colleagues; we will never solve a real problem without exploring our options. In essence; dare to be wrong
Curious and always on the lookout for improvements - maybe we should implement a new library in our tech stack? Maybe the framework we have chosen for the app is not the optimal one? Suggestions to better shape our work methodology? Have some concerns around the UX? Let us know!
Selfless and collaborative, always eager to share your knowledge with others - we all have our own area of expertise. You will bring some of the technical know-how, but you will also work closely with people from different areas of the organization. It’s not always coding, debugging and deployment, you actually need to understand the full picture.

Finally, and this should be self explanatory as this is a very senior position😉 - you should have experience with modern frontend technologies. We don’t expect you to be familiar with all of the technologies we use - however, experience with for example TypeScript would make it a whole lot easier for you to join the team and hit the ground running.

Here’s a Rough Overview Of Our Techstack

Typescript

Angular (2+ versions)

RXJS

Graphql

D3.js

Fabric.js

HTML

CSS

We use the latest and greatest version of our tech stack. Also, we try to modularize things - so any experience with creating reusable libraries or using NX for workspace would be really beneficial.

We Offer
Money.
We chip in on your pension and keep you covered with medical insurance.

We believe that now is the time to reevaluate the tools and methods we use to measure the impact of spaces where we live, work, and play. Building sustainably at a global scale requires better technology and processes for the people involved. We're attacking this at the core -- Outer Labs provides modern human-centric apps for stakeholders who can directly influence the way real estate, architecture, and construction decisions are made.

Some questions we find ourselves asking: How can technology help an Architect explore thousands of ideas in the time it currently takes to explore one? How can software optimize the quality of space for usability while reducing the cost and resources required to build? How do we encourage adoption of reusable solutions that can be manufactured more sustainably and efficiently?

Answers to these questions require deep expertise in design and engineering that comes from every level of our company. This is why we’ve invested deeply in building a culture that empowers its employees to do great work and directly shape the future of its products. We want smart, creative, and intentional individuals to be part of our core team. Are you in?

Job Description

We are actively seeking an experienced, creative, and pragmatic Senior Software Engineer with a focus on computational geometry to join our growing team. The engineering team is a mix of people from traditional CS backgrounds as well as non-traditional backgrounds such as architecture, mechanical engineering, music, and more. We value this diversity and pride ourselves on being a place that creates opportunities for motivated individuals to move into technology careers.

Our stack includes Typescript, React, ThreeJS, Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform. We strive to write clean, maintainable code that is tested, documented, and understood across the team. We are a small team, and you will work on a variety of problems across the stack.

Manage individual project priorities, deadlines, and deliverables, on the order of 1-3 month efforts; strive to reduce complexity and simplify software systems for smoother future productivity and maintenance
Once work is assigned, work in a largely self-directed manner, but raise issues to your manager before you get blocked
Perform technical investigations on sometimes open-ended problems, form well-researched and defensible opinions on technical decisions
Contribute to the development of team-wide best practices with regards to code review, architecture patterns, deployments, and more
Contribute to the creation of team-level goals
Develop a strong understanding of important topics in AEC and how Outer Labs’ mission & vision relates
Collaborate with other disciplines on our team, including product management, design, and business development
Proactively communicate with other members of the team, and sometimes external clients
Teach what you know, acting as a mentor when appropriate, while staying open to a process of constant learning
Qualifications

Outcome-oriented, creative, and proactive personality
4-7+ years of experience in a professional software engineering role, or equivalent
Expertise in computational geometry and spatial algorithms
Deep knowledge of computational, parametric, and generative design
Experience with geometric modeling tools, such as Revit, Dynamo, Rhino, Grasshopper, and/or 3ds Max
Experience with system design
Knowledge of machine learning algorithms is preferred
Ability to scope and manage complex tasks in the 1-3 month timeframe
Ability to manage risks in your tasks. You should generally resolve blockages on your own, but escalate when necessary. Help others with problems they're facing.
Experience with software deployments, devops, and tooling for developer productivity
Ability to take on tech lead designation; this includes scoping and organizing work for yourself and potentially others on your team
Deep experience with React + Typescript; Golang experience a plus.
Enthusiasm for collaborative work. Outer Labs values working on projects together, bouncing ideas off each other, and swapping responsibilities as necessary to work quickly and smoothly.
Strong communication skills. Outer Labs is a 100% remote/distributed company. We communicate through written documents, Slack, Hangouts, phone, and email. You should be a good listener and reader as well as able to get your ideas across clearly and respectfully.
Passion for mentorship and being empathetic. Outer Labs strongly believes in supporting early career engineers and ones from non traditional backgrounds
Experience or interest in AEC (Architecture, Engineering, & Construction) is a huge plus

The Company

Devant was founded in 2021 in Sweden, and provides high-quality synthetic data to support the training, validation and testing of Machine Learning networks. Offering unparalleled data customization, we deliver lifelike 3D simulations that enable Machine Learning developers to generate any real-life scenario. This empowers businesses to boost the performance of their computer vision applications, while also reducing bias normally associated with human-centric data.

Our team includes experts from the VFX, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning industries.

Devant’s aim, in collaboration with existing and future partners, is to continue to lead the synthetic data market and in turn, help revolutionise the speed of technological innovation across a variety of industries and enable safe and trustworthy human-machine interaction.

Job Description

The role

Key to our success is our ability to create highly detailed and accurate digital representations of synthetic humans in a variety of real-world scenarios. We produce these after careful consideration of our clients' specific requirements, accounting for things like the configuration of population distributions, how our digital humans should move and interact, environmental conditions, and many more.

This work requires us to efficiently model and configure each unique scenario we're presented with, solving complex constraint satisfaction problems along the way. Once configured, each scenario must tap into our content library - where many of the assets can be controlled procedurally - to make sure we pick the right pieces for the job at hand. Done correctly, our machines can then produce tens of thousands of unique scenario configurations at the press of a single button - all ready to be passed on to our fully automated rendering pipeline.

We are now looking for a motivated Senior Software Engineer with extensive experience in the modelling and data domains to improve our abilities in this area. As a key member of the team, you will report directly to our Chief Product Officer.

Responsibilities

Collaborate closely with our CPO to design a system that effectively ingests and translates our customers' requirements to our own internal format, minimising ambiguity along the way
Lead the development efforts that allow us to efficiently model and solve constraints for existing and new scenarios alike, while handling scenario complexity and distribution requirements without breaking a sweat
Help us decrease the time from “first test batch produced"" to ""final customer sign-off”. Our ambition is to provide a set of products that let us incorporate multiple rounds of feedback - from any of our customers - on a daily basis, effectively producing gradually refined versions of any of our customers’ data sets within minutes (rather than hours or days)
Continually improve how we serve and present our data sets to a variety of consumers, including our own web-based suite of products as well as third-party integrations
Qualifications

Past experiences that we believe could be helpful in this role

Extensive real-world experience in data modelling, transformation and storage
Development and deployment of models/solvers in a variety of domains
Extensive experience in building and running high-performant services in Python
Development of products for debugging and visualising the inner workings of state machines and/or computational graph nodes
Experience in statistical analysis, as well as the creation, transformation, manipulation and visualisation of data sets. Preferably through numpy, matplotlib, scipy et al.

“I’m all about the user experience. Everything a user sees and interacts with, that’s what I’m responsible for. It needs to be slick, efficient and intuitive – which is all down to me.”

What You Will Really Be Doing

🚀 Creating remarkable software that our customers will love, using modern technologies

⭐️ Prioritize, coordinate and support the team’s daily work

❓ Getting challenged with complex and interesting problems

👩🏻‍💻 Mentoring and guiding junior developers on your team

⚒️ Work alongside Architects and DevOps Engineers on technical architecture, deployment, and infrastructure

🎉 Contribute to shaping the culture and methodology of a growing software house

How Will You Be Doing This
You’re part of an agile, multidisciplinary team building features for our product. You bring your own unique skill set to the table and collaborate both with your own team members and other colleagues across teams to accomplish your goals.
Work with the UX designers from the concept phase to the specification and finalizing phase to derive the solution.
Collaborate with team members responsible for the API part, discuss and finalize the needs to make the process efficient.
You prioritize work with the team and its product owner, weighing both the business and technical value of each task.
Groom the tasks by understanding the functional aspect and applying the best technical solutioning to it.
Train and help the junior team members with your experience in technology and process, so that they grow and become an even bigger asset to the team.

Where you will be doing this

You will be based in Oslo, Norway as we continue to build our teams but since we follow a hybrid working model, feel free to combine work + vacation into a workation! Nestle in one of our cabins by ski centers like Gaustablikk, Hafjell ++, relax on a balcony with an ocean view or even visit family and friends around the world (and make sure to take some days off to spend quality time with the fam!) while carrying out your work. While we encourage flexibility in your preferred work style, it is important to harmonize & integrate that with the needs of your team and colleagues while maintaining your base in Oslo.

What we have worked on and where we are going

We have set a product vision for the future and defined a one-product strategy for Aize. We are now moving into the execution phase and are in need of more doers who want to challenge themselves as well as us as a product company. As an organization, we’re constantly evolving which means that a lot of opportunities will appear as we move forward. Maybe you want to be an expert in a particular area, manage a team or even seek a different career path? At Aize you’ll have the opportunity to explore and evolve together with us.

Team

As we have different teams who are in need of new team member(s)r - we are open to hear about your skills, experiences and motivation before suggesting the right team for you. However, all our teams are cross functional and multidisciplinary - and even though you will be working in one product team with its responsibility for a feature, everything at Aize is so connected that you will essentially be involved in the development of the entire product.

A few teasers on what you might end up doing in our teams:
Help in making the code manageable and maintainable
Creating novel solutions for expressing information on web interfaces
Working extensively on Canvas and SVG elements of Web
Working with some of the brightest minds who work with 3D technologies
Innovating our 2D area and work on further developing functionality of smart documents
Work closely with designers and be involved in shaping the UX for a new feature

Who We Think You Are
Passionate about technology and driven by problem solving - we care about what we do, and so should you
Responsible and courageous - innovation is not something that just happens. You ask questions, participate in discussions, disagree with your colleagues; we will never solve a real problem without exploring our options. In essence; dare to be wrong
Curious and always on the lookout for improvements - maybe we should implement a new library in our tech stack? Maybe the framework we have chosen for the app is not the optimal one? Suggestions to better shape our work methodology? Have some concerns around the UX? Let us know!
Selfless and collaborative, always eager to share your knowledge with others - we all have our own area of expertise. You will bring some of the technical know-how, but you will also work closely with people from different areas of the organization. It’s not always coding, debugging and deployment, you actually need to understand the full picture.

Finally, and this should be self explanatory as this is a very senior position😉 - you should have experience with modern frontend technologies. We don’t expect you to be familiar with all of the technologies we use - however, experience with for example TypeScript would make it a whole lot easier for you to join the team and hit the ground running.

Here’s a Rough Overview Of Our Techstack

Typescript

Angular (2+ versions)

RXJS

Graphql

D3.js

Fabric.js

HTML

CSS

We use the latest and greatest version of our tech stack. Also, we try to modularize things - so any experience with creating reusable libraries or using NX for workspace would be really beneficial.

We believe that now is the time to reevaluate the tools and methods we use to measure the impact of spaces where we live, work, and play. Building sustainably at a global scale requires better technology and processes for the people involved. We're attacking this at the core -- Outer Labs provides modern human-centric apps for stakeholders who can directly influence the way real estate, architecture, and construction decisions are made.

Some questions we find ourselves asking: How can technology help an Architect explore thousands of ideas in the time it currently takes to explore one? How can software optimize the quality of space for usability while reducing the cost and resources required to build? How do we encourage adoption of reusable solutions that can be manufactured more sustainably and efficiently?

Answers to these questions require deep expertise in design and engineering that comes from every level of our company. This is why we’ve invested deeply in building a culture that empowers its employees to do great work and directly shape the future of its products. We want smart, creative, and intentional individuals to be part of our core team. Are you in?

Job Description

We are actively seeking an experienced, creative, and pragmatic Senior Software Engineer to join our growing team. The engineering team is a mix of people from traditional CS backgrounds as well as non-traditional backgrounds such as architecture, mechanical engineering, music, and more. We value this diversity and pride ourselves on being a place that creates opportunities for motivated individuals to move into technology careers.

Our stack includes Golang, React, Typescript, ThreeJS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform. We strive to write clean, maintainable code that is tested, documented, and understood across the team. We are a small team, and you will work on a variety of problems across the stack. You will have a voice and influence on technical direction and decisions, and are expected to contribute to making our team the best it can be.

What You’ll Do:

Design, develop, test, deploy, maintain, and improve Outer Labs software
Manage both individual and team-wide project priorities, deadlines, and deliverables
Act as a pillar of the software engineering team, using your experience to help guide technical decisions and direction
Perform technical investigations on sometimes open-ended problems, form well-researched and defensible opinions on technical decisions
Participate in code and design reviews; provide strong but constructive opinions on how to improve the quality of our infrastructure and our products; and suggest and implement creative solutions to the challenges we encounter.
Collaborate with other disciplines on our team, including product management, design, and business development
Proactively communicate with other members of the team, and sometimes external clients
Teach what you know, acting as a mentor when appropriate, while staying open to a process of constant learning
Qualifications

8+ years software development experience in one or more general purpose programming languages.
Deep experience with Java. You will be expected to learn many new tools, but this will form the foundation of your role.
Experience working with development practices at scale, or in large organizations.
Ability to think abstractly about complex systems
Enthusiasm for collaborative work. Outer Labs values working on projects together, bouncing ideas off each other, and swapping responsibilities as necessary to work quickly and smoothly.
Strong communication skills. Outer Labs is a highly remote/distributed company. We communicate through written documents, Slack, Hangouts, phone, and email. You should be a good listener and reader as well as able to get your ideas across clearly and respectfully.
BS degree in Computer Science, similar technical field of study or equivalent practical experience.
Experience or interest in AEC (Architecture, Engineering, & Construction) is a huge plus.

Additional Information

Exposure to safety certification standards and processes
Proven agility in fast-changing environments. As a scale-up, we’re constantly evolving so our people need to evolve too for us to succeed together
A customer-centric outlook. Chances are you won’t be directly customer facing, but we value people who anticipate and prioritise the needs of our customers. We call it ‘inventing on their behalf.’

The Candidate Journey: Multi-Step and Two-Way

Founded in 2015, Maple is a fast-growing health tech company with a vision to power the future of healthcare by building a connected and superior experience for patients, doctors, and other types of health providers.

We offer virtual care services across multiple distribution channels, including Direct-to-Consumer (""B2C""), Employers and Private Insurers (""B2B"") and Public Sector Institutions (""B2I""). With a growing network of 2,000+ healthcare providers and nearly 4 million Canadians accessing our services, Maple is one of Canada’s fastest-growing virtual care companies.

We have established an entrepreneurial culture centered around our purpose to support people’s health and well-being, and to strengthen the healthcare system.

We’re growing our engineering team to scale multiple business lines and enhance access to healthcare for Canadians. We’re looking for passionate developers who want to make an impact and thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic environment with an open culture and flat hierarchy.

At Maple, our engineering team builds the applications and services that support doctors, patients, and healthcare facilities. Our apps are built using React Native and TypeScript to ensure we can ship fast, with iOS and Android deployments through App Center. Our APIs have comprehensive test suites using PHPUnit, Cypress, and k6 load testing, along with branch-level preview environments orchestrated through Ansible and Terraform. Our goal is to create a fast, scalable, accessible experience for our users – whether it’s a patient messaging their therapist in a secure chat, a doctor providing urgent care over a video call, or a nurse practitioner triaging their virtual Emergency Room.

We’ll support and challenge you as you develop your technical and leadership skills in a scaling environment. You enjoy thinking creatively, solving challenges, and developing fresh ideas to design Canada's leading virtual healthcare platform.

Collaborate with designers, product owners, and non-technical teammates (e.g. operations, business development) to deliver impactful products.

CANDIDATE PROFILE
You have expertise in developing and deploying application software in modern mobile, frontend, and backend environments. You have 5+ years of experience working with PHP and the Laravel framework. You are familiar with modern javascript frameworks, including React (preferred), Vue, or Angular.
You champion engineering best practices, understand the build environments, and can solve complex asynchronous problems.
Additionally, you have production-level experience with the following:
MySQL or another relational database
Automated unit testing frameworks
Redux or other state management tool
API design using REST (GraphQL or JSON: API is a plus)

Not checking every box? Please apply anyway. We understand that candidates have different experiences that may make them a fantastic fit for this position, and for Maple.

F45 utilizes proprietary technologies: a fitness programming algorithm and a patented technology-enabled delivery platform that leverages a rich content database of over 4,000 unique functional training movements to offer new workouts each day and provide a standardized experience across the Company's global footprint in over 65+ countries.

In this key role, you’ll be responsible for the development of F45’s proprietary heart rate monitoring and wearable technology, LionHeart. The LionHeart system tracks participant heart rate zones through a wireless heart rate monitor and displays the results in realtime on the studio leaderboard. At the end of every class, the LionHeart system compiles a participant's workout session into a summary graph that can then be viewed within the F45 iOS/Android App.

LionHeart has been highlighted as one of F45’s fastest growing technologies and offers extensive gamification opportunities. As the Lead LionHeart Engineer, you will be responsible for completing the migration of the LionHeart backend system into AWS (the migration is nearly done but requires testing and configuration updates) and supporting the platform’s evolution. Additionally, you will work closely with the Product Team to develop new features that will engage and motivate members to achieve their fitness goals.

This is a software engineering role that requires in-depth knowledge of PHP and backend technologies. You will be responsible for keeping the service running and updating the application to use the latest PHP and framework version. While the position works very closely with hardware (heart rate monitor and in-studio Hubs), you will not be directly responsible for hardware related issues or building firmware; this position is entirely focused on backend API development and ancillary technologies (sending emails via API, computing data analytics, querying data from a database, updating a simple frontend website, etc.).

This role will regularly engage with stakeholders throughout the development cycle. As such, the ideal candidate must have excellent communication skills and understanding of agile practices.

The ideal candidate is a self-starter who is not only a talented engineer but is also willing to lean in and support the company in other cross-disciplinary areas including analytics and data reconciliation.

This role is a perfect opportunity for those who are interested in leveraging their software engineering skills to support the company’s digital evolution in the fitness industry.

Location: Remote (or hybrid). Candidates either from Austin, Texas or willing to work in US central time alignment (regardless of base location in US) are encouraged to apply.

Tech Stack: PHP/laravel, MongoDB, RDS (MySQL), redis, and NodeJS.

Responsibilities

Develop and push out new features to LionHeart and supporting systems
Coordinate closely with the Product Team to deliver new features and hit key milestones
Responsible for completing the migration of all LionHeart backend services into AWS
Execute data governance and compliance for biometric and heart rate data (ie. configure archive/deletion policies)
Write unit and integration tests for critical paths of the system
Actively monitor service notifications within NewRelic to retain high service uptime
Participate in daily stand ups and weekly sprint planning meetings
Triage critical issues and resolve bugs

Requirements

Minimum 5 years of experience programming in PHP and OOP; experience programming in PHP 8.x (latest major version) is a big plus
Experience working with Laravel is a core requirement. Must have demonstrable understanding of Lavavel’s philosophy, methodology and practical ways of working with and extending Lavavel
Experience working with version control systems (ie. Github) is required; an active Github profile with contributions to open-source or public projects is expected
Experience writing unit/integration tests
Familiarity with Docker is desired
Expert proficiency in SQL database design, modeling, and querying
Excellent proficiency in Javascript and ES6. Experience in NodeJS (backend), React, Vue, and other frontend technologies (CSS/SASS) is a plus
Extensive knowledge of the AWS ecosystem (ECS, RDS, S3, deployment pipelines)
Experience working in Agile settings and strong understanding of Agile processes
Strong interpersonal skills and ability to work effectively with both onshore and offshore teams as well as non-technical stakeholders
Proven communication skills – both written and verbal
Able to work in a high energy environment and flexibility to manage change.

Serious bonus points

While these are great-to-haves, these are by no means disqualifying as many extremely talented developers haven’t checked most of these off.

Fitness is an important part of your life or you have a daily gym routine!
You have a passion for fitness wearable technology
You consider debugging bugs and writing code one of your super powers
You can find answers on the net like it’s nobody’s business
You participate in forums related to software engineering on a weekly basis

You might be sitting at your desk, you might be on the way to or from work, either way, the chances are you’re probably reading this because you’re not that happy with the way things are in your current job, or you’re up for a new challenge. While there might not be a better way to build products, there are always better products to be built.

So what are we building?

Most Australians don’t think about their superannuation until they are at a point in life where they are forced to think of their own mortality and plan for the future. Usually, the question they ask themselves is “who is going to look after me when I get older”. For me, that moment was when I got a dog, for others it was the birth of their first child.

If you aren’t in the industry, most of the administration platforms (the software that tracks everything to do with your super) are built on things you or your parents would recognise from the glory days of 90’s computing. Not even joking here...

Our platform is brand new, with the latest tech and if it fits the goal of making super easier to understand, information more accessible and gets people to focus on their super so they can retire comfortably, we will build it. Once we shake up the super industry, there are plenty of opportunities to shake up other wealth administration sectors.

How are we doing it?

We are design-driven, with a passion for creating beautiful, user-friendly products. Our teams, from the Senior Leadership Team through to the Engineering Interns, collaborate together to bring our products to life.

We seek to create an environment that values different perspectives. We do this by striving to give every individual a voice, regardless of their position. We believe this leads to better outcomes in our technology and for our customers.

We want every person to come to work as their authentic selves and have every opportunity to contribute to their individual success as well as our collective success.

Are you looking to accelerate your career growth by joining an early-stage company going after a massive market opportunity?

Visor is a fast-growing company simplifying how people work together. Our vision is to become everyone's favorite place to collaborate on data from anywhere. Visor's product looks like a spreadsheet so everyone knows how to use it. But it's the world's most deeply connected spreadsheet, making entirely new solutions possible.

The company was founded at Harvard. We're backed by the same investors as Airbnb, Shopify, Zapier, Hubspot, and Warby Parker. We have thousands of users worldwide.

We have raised funding (both announced and unannounced) and have plenty of runway. We don't have plans to fundraise for 2+ years.

The role:

We are looking for an experienced software engineer who loves building products. You will become the primary owner of our product engineering. As part of the founding team, you will work alongside the CEO and collaborate daily with the product and design teams. You will be asked to think and act like a founder, and you will be treated as an owner.

Within the first month, you'll start shipping production-quality code. By month three, we'd like you to start pointing out threats/opportunities for our technical systems. By month six, you'll be partnering with the CEO on architectural decisions. And by month nine, you'll take the primary lead on architectural decisions.

Given the complexity of building a spreadsheet that works flawlessly with live-syncing external data, we have to keep the foundation rock solid. You will be a foundational part of our long-term strategizing and expected to plan our architecture three chess moves ahead of where we are today.

Who you are:

You have a Bachelors in Computer Science (preferred) or other relevant credentials that demonstrate deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and programming patterns
You're an seasoned engineer who has 5+ years of experience building front end web applications, ideally some of that experience using VueJs (or other front-end web frameworks)
You have a deep command of the contemporary Javascript language — more knowledgeable than most
A self-motivated learner who loves improving your skills and knowledge
A collaborative engineer who prioritizes the total output of the whole team over personal achievement
You're willing to recommend improvements to the company's existing practices but open to accept and embrace the architectural decisions and technologies already used
You're deeply interested in product quality, performance, and reliability (not just building new things)
You're comfortable speaking your mind and sharing your opinions
Detail-oriented. To prove it, please include a sentence in your cover letter referencing this line and include this word: meticulous.

What you'll be doing:

Design and build front-end architecture for the core platform (Javascript, VueJS)
Gradually assume some engineering leadership responsibilities, including priority-setting, leading our process, and making major architecture and technology decisions
Collaborate with our back-end engineer to design robust, scalable APIs, systems, and architecture
Identify and resolve QA issues across the product
Own and advocate for the health and quality of the systems the team builds
Document your work and our architecture for improved collaboration
Join customer feedback calls to develop and share opinions about our roadmap and technical requirements
Collaborate with our design leader to establish and maintain a global design system with standard UI components that improve speed and quality of execution
Periodically create content about our engineering to keep our customers informed and help us document our engineering culture

Salary range:

We believe in providing transparency into our pay plans to help eliminate the salary gap. The following describes our expected compensation range for this position. In these annual figures, we include the value of the employee's regular salary and discretionary bonuses. We do not include other parts of the company's compensation package, including: equity & options, benefits such as healthcare, unlimited PTO, and budgets for travel & equipment.

Please note that we may be able to extend offers outside of this range in order to match a wider range of candidate experiences and skills. If you are more experienced and have salary expectations higher than this range, please reach out to see if we should continue the conversation.

At tacto, we believe that the next wave of technical progress will reshape the industrial world, the backbone of our economy. Procurement is the biggest value-driver in industrial organizations while its complexity in terms of parts, suppliers, requirements, and supply chains is ever-increasing. Organizations lack future-proof tools to retrieve actionable knowledge from the vast amount of information available - our opportunity.

We founded tacto to build an intuitive and data-driven procurement solution to focus on what matters by automating what does not.

Tasks

As one of the first team members in engineering, you will shape our design decisions and address some of the most difficult technical challenges to build cutting-edge software. This is a high impact role where you will be part of the core team, shape the product, and help us to deliver value to our customers.

Proactively communicate, document, and share your approach, progress, results, and challenges
Spread an engineering culture of quality and innovation across the organization

Requirements

Now you may wonder what frameworks, tools, and languages you need to master. We believe that problem solving, creativity, and drive are more important than tools that can be picked up. However, the following references will give a guideline of what experiences we think might be helpful.

You are familiar with frontend libraries and frameworks such as React or Vue
You used component libraries such as Material UI, Quasar, or Vuetify in the past and extended your app with own components
You have developed a RESTful API with frameworks such as Django, Express, or Rails
You have used object-oriented programming languages such as Python, Go, or TypeScript
You know how to deploy applications to services such as Azure, GCP, or AWS
You designed a data model and know how to set up a database such as PostgreSQL

Take an active role in shaping the industrial future with us. You will have a direct impact on our product, our users, our organization, and our engineering practices while working closely with the founders. You will be part of an effective, autonomous team, where you can solve technical challenges in a hands-on and high-impact environment.

We are curious and love to learn new things that let us grow personally and professionally
We give honest and direct feedback to make sure we are continually improving

SEs are responsible for the scalability and maintainability of the codebase, and for identifying and adopting new technology and frameworks.

Indirectly, SEs assist the rest of the team by ensuring that QA has the tools necessary to test the application; ensuring design is creating mockups and wireframes that are technically sound; and the product owner has a reasonable understanding of the technical state of the product.

SEs are familiar with technologies such as HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript/Typescript, Vue, Vite/Webpack, Python, C# .NET, or SQL.

Requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent and typically reports to a supervisor or manager.

If you’re looking to be a part of something special, Beast Code is the place to be an SE. We are proud to be recognized by Great Place to Work and FORTUNE Magazine as one of the 50 Best Small Workplaces. We’ve also been honored with 2019 The Enterprise Florida Entrepreneur and Job Growth Award. Hey, it’s not bragging if you can back it up.

Kontakt.io is a fast-growing company. It is extremely important for us to work with people who value the same virtues and fit our culture. Successful cooperation means that you:

Lead customer-centric - customer leadership is the key. If a customer has a problem we don’t wait. We understand what customer needs and we tailor our services, products around the customer. It doesn’t mean that we let the customer lead us. It means that we think about the customer first
Have a growth mindset - we commit to results and growth. We are responsible for results, not for the activity or time spent. If we believe we can’t achieve a result or a job, it’s our duty to raise the voice, push back, explain what we suggest instead. We don’t see results as something static - ever. This means that our results and expectations are becoming more ambitious, quarter over quarter. We constantly evolve
Challenge, inspire, respect - we are the challenger in the marketplace. When working with each other - or with customers - we enjoy and desire to challenge each other. We listen, reflect and respond. We aim to understand the point of view of the other party and if there is customer merit in the argument. When we challenge, we articulate our hypothesis clearly and provide data and evidence in our argumentation. We respect the time of our colleagues. We have a zero-tolerance towards discrimination of any kind. We respect the environment
Execute systematically - We recognize that the start-up journey will only be successful if we learn twice as much as others in half the time. For us, innovation also means continuous improvement in all fields. We think in systems when driving results, growth, and learnings
Act with urgency - We have a sense of urgency in everything we do - at all times. It’s deeply rooted in the belief that as an up-start, as a challenger, we need to drive value for our customers faster and better than anybody else in the marketplace. We do things outside of the personal comfort zone",NA,Be among the first 25 applicants,Not Applicable,Contract,6 days ago

Historically companies have had to choose between speed or accuracy in their intake decisions. That’s a problem because the inability to quickly intake documents in any format and accurately make decisions, inhibits your growth and frustrates your customers.

What you’ll do?

As our Principal Software Engineer / Lead Developer you’ll run our bespoke development team. This role will be a combination of hands-on development and people management.

As our Principal Software Engineer / Lead Developer you’ll support a relatively junior team, so being able to coach on the technical side will be crucial. This team works on smaller little custom bitesize projects and there is scope to try new technologies or methods if appropriate. We encourage you to be creative.

Most of the projects are on train planning support, modelling and simulation activities – the latter being where you are artificially running the station to see impact from risks. You’ll build tools to report on the planning, validate plans and look at optimisation work.

The process will be 2 stages consisting of both technical and competency questioning. If you need any reasonable adjustments, please let a member of the team know.

Who you’ll be?

Fundamentals in object-oriented design, data structures, algorithms and problem solving. (We don't expect leetcode jargon but fundamentals like Maps, Trees and Graphs are important)
Experience using Flask/Django or NodeJS (or any other backend framework for that matter - if you're good in one you're good in all).

Owing to outdated processes and bad actors, traditional debt collection is rife with harassment and fraud. Our products tackle this by helping financial institutions modernize collections, giving borrowers simpler and more compassionate ways to get back on track.

What's in it for you:

Senior Software Engineers at January aren't just responsible for writing code. You'll also own product and team outcomes, advocate for customers, and help other engineers grow.

The main ways you'll impact the business are:

Borrower Experience. You'll work to make the collections experience simpler and more empathetic for borrowers, improving recoveries. This might include running experiments to improve conversion, analyzing user behavior to find opportunities, and designing reinforcement learning models to automate decision-making.
Client Experience. Build simple, best-in-class tools to help creditors engage with their borrowers, analyze effectiveness, and automate operations.
Technical Leverage. Develop simple solutions to complex technical scaling problems, improving developer leverage, reliability, security, and compliance. Depending on your areas of expertise, this may include infrastructure scaling, domain modeling, performance optimization, and continuous deployment.
Developing Peers. You'll level up other engineers by sharing your knowledge of systems, engineering practices, and the problem domain, helping ensure their success. You'll do this through code review, pair programming, documentation, and just plain being supportive.

As the company grows, you will be involved in scoping, architecting, and implementing new product lines. You'll have the opportunity to build new lines of business from scratch.

You might be a fit if you value:

Genuine collaboration. We recognize and explicitly reward feedback, alignment, and learning from each other.
Managers as advocates. You'll report to leaders invested in your growth and promotion, not just their own. Managers only succeed when their teams thrive.
Outcomes over output. We value finding ways to do more with less, working smart instead of burning out.
Product ownership. Engineers are owners, not mercenaries. Everyone plays a role in discovering, advocating for, and implementing product ideas.
Technical quality. We work collaboratively with product to ensure great outcomes without sacrificing quality. Sustainable development is a first class priority.

What you bring to the table:

Have 5+ years of experience as a Software Engineer
Have led the planning and execution of complex projects
Enjoy and thrive in an environment where you're a mentor to junior-level engineers
Want the chance to collaborate closely with your peers
